# UnionFlight Data Reader


## MVP

### From Xplane :

The objective is to get data from xplane via a UDP connection with the simulator

I thank @MaxFerretti. Thanks to the [XPlaneConnector](https://github.com/MaxFerretti/XPlaneConnector) repo  I was able to understand more quickly how udp works with Xplane.
